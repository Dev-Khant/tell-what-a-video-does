# Video Understanding and Q&A Tool

This project allows you to input a YouTube video link, and it provides a comprehensive understanding of the video's content through audio transcription and image captioning. **LLM** is used to combine audio and video context. Additionally, you can ask questions and it will provide responses according to video content 🚀

## Features ✨

👉 **Video Understanding**: The tool utilizes the **Transformer** model for audio transcription, converting spoken words into textual format. It also employs image captioning techniques to extract text from images within the video. **Image embeddings** are also used to compare images and only use images unique for extracting info. Video and Audio are processed **parallelly**.

👉 **Question & Answer**: Users can ask questions about the video's content. The tool leverages the power of **Chromadb** as a vector database to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## How to Use ⚙️

• Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Dev-Khant/tell-what-a-video-does.git`

• Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

• Run the streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`

• Provide **YouTube video** with your **OpenAI token**, **Huggingface token**, **SerpAPI token**

## Technical 🖥️

• [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/): Utilized to access the OpenAI Whisper model for audio transcription.

• [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/): Used it to access Google Lens API for getting image information.

• [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Used to create the interactive web interface for the project.

• [Chromadb](https://www.trychroma.com/): The vector database used for storing and retrieving Q&A information.

## Work in Progress 🚧

1. Add Weaviate and let the user select their VectorDB.
2. Internet access to chatbot.
3. Option to upload video.
4. Store video explanations so they can be used later.
